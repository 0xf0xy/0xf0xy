## > About Me
> Well, you found this profile.  
> That already tells me something about you.  
>
> So now, let me tell you something about me:  
> I'm not chasing fame or glory —  
> I'm here because I like this world.  
> 
> At first, hacking was just a way to disconnect from reality,  
> a challenge to silence the chaos within.  
> But now, it’s a passion that keeps me going.  
>
> I learn by breaking.  
> I grow by solving.
