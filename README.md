## ❖ About Me
> Well, you found this profile.  
> That already tells me something about you.
>
> So now, let me tell you something about myself:  
> I don’t consider myself a hacker — just an enthusiast.  
> I’m not chasing fame or glory.  
> I’m here because I **love** it.
>
> At first, hacking was just an escape —  
> a way to disconnect from reality,  
>a challenge to silence the chaos within.  
> But over time, it became something much more.
