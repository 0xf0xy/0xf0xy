## > About Me
> Well, you found this profile. <br>
> That already tells me something about you. <br>
>
> So now, let me tell you something about me: <br>
> I'm not chasing fame or glory â€” <br>
> I'm here because I like this world. <br>
> 
> At first, hacking was just a way to disconnect from reality, <br>
> a challenge to silence the chaos within. <br>
> But now, itâ€™s a passion that keeps me going.
